```bash
npm install   # or yarn / pnpm
npm run dev

Environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add:

VITE_RPC_SEPOLIA=
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_PINATA_JWT=
# or legacy keys
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=
VITE_PINATA_API_SECRET=
VITE_PINATA_GATEWAY=gateway.pinata.cloud

Do NOT commit your .env file.

Prereqs
- Node.js >= 18
- A supported wallet (MetaMask) in the browser

Setup
1) Install dependencies
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   yarn

2) Run the app
   npm run dev

3) Optional: enable WalletConnect
   Create a .env file in the project root and add:
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID={{YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID}}

Where to provide contract addresses
- Go to Settings in the app and paste the deployed addresses for each contract.
- Chain ID can also be set there (e.g. 11155111 for Sepolia, 80002 for Polygon Amoy).

Replace/Update ABIs
- All ABIs are under src/abi/*.json
- Replace any file with your new ABI JSON
- Update imports if you rename files: see src/contracts/abis.ts

🔗 Contracts & ABIs

All ABIs are in src/abi/*.json

🧑‍💼 UserIdentityRegistry → verifyFace, verifyAadhaar, verifyIncome, getUserProfile

📜 CertificateManager → issue/revoke/verify certificates

🏢 OrganizationRegistry → register/approve organizations

🌍 GlobalCredentialAnchor → anchor/revoke credentials

🔗 CrossChainManager → cross-chain anchoring

🏳️ RecognitionManager → add/revoke country recognitions

📝 VerificationLogger → user logs with pagination


🧑‍💻 Verification Flow

👤 Face → capture webcam image → SHA-256 hash → verifyFace

🪪 Aadhaar → upload QR/document → hash → verifyAadhaar

💰 Income → upload proof + income → hash → verifyIncome

🔏 ZK Proof → choose ABI method with bytes proof input


🔒 Security Notes

❌ No hardcoded contract addresses

🛑 Missing address → UI prompts in Settings

🧩 Proofs must be 0x-prefixed hex (generation is out of scope)
